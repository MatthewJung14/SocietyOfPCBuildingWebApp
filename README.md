# SocietyOfPCBuildingWebApp

Project Name: SPCB Web App

Project Description: The Society of PC Building is a registered student organization at UF.
The organization's main purpose is to teach students how simple the process of building a 
computer is as well as provide hands-on experience doing so. Recently, The SPCB has been
in need of a hosted web applicaiton that will include many features. For example, an 
implemented calendar to tell members when meetings and other events are, a small blog post
to post pictures of recent meetings and builds, and an admin portal to login and edit the
website all all necessary features for the organization. Furthermore, The SPCB collaborates
with many other organizations on campus, and thus a club collaboration form would be beneficial. 
Bio pages for each of the officers, an About Us page, and a Testimonials page for students who
had received PC builds from the org are other small features we are considering.
Finally, The SPCB recently collaborated with Gator E-Sports to create a PC gaming room within
The Reitz Student Union. They will need an application that allows UF students to rent out 
PCs for certain time slots to properly implement this game room.
