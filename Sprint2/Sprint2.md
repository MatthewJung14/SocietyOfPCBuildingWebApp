**BACKEND DOCUMENTATION**
Packages:
  main - Thusfar, the only 'real' package. Contains all of the API endpoints and handles all of the routing. This will need to be better organized in the future; we need to place the various functions in other packages based on their functionality.
    Structs:
      User - A gorm model struct which is used in the SQLite database to represent a user and their credentials. The primary key has been manually changed to be the user's email address.
      Env - A struct with a single field: a pointer to a gorm.DB instance. This exists so that we don't have to manually open the database in every function that needs it.
    Functions:
      getHash - A very simple function that passes in a []byte and returns the corresponding hash generated by bcrypt. Called by userLogin and userRegister.
      GenerateJWT - Returns a JSON web token (JWT) signed using HS256. Tokens are set to expire 24 hours after generation. Called by userLogin.
      test - Prints "Test success" when called. Called by the /api/test endpoint.
      userRegister - An Env struct behavior. Creates a new entry in the User table of the database provided that no other entry with the same email exists. Called by /api/signup endpoint.
      userLogin - An Env struct behavior. Compares hashes of the provided password string with the corresponding entry in the User table provided such an entry exists. If the hashes match, a JWT is returned along with a success message. Called by /api/login endpoint.
      deactivateUser - An Env struct behavior. Deletes the user with provided email address from the User table provided they exist. This deletion is a hard delete using a raw SQL statement, hence the deletion is permanent. Called by /api/deactivate-account endpoint.
      updateUser - An Env struct behavior. Updates the user's account information with the provided changes provided that the user exists in the User table. Does not update the email address. Called by /api/update-account endpoint.
    Middleware Handlers:
      ValidateJWT - Checks that the value mapped to the "Token" key in a passed in http request is a valid JWT. Writes a response message telling the caller that they are unauthorized if the token is invalid or if there is no token at all. If the token is valid, the passed in function is allowed to execute. Endpoints which are wrapped by this handler: /api/test and /api/deactivate-account.
    API Endpoints:
      /api/test - Calls the test function. Uses the ValidateJWT handler. Accepts http GET requests.
      /api/signup - Calls the userRegister function. No additional middleware handlers. Accepts http POST requests.
      /api/login - Calls the userLogin function. No additional middleware handlers. Accepts http POST requests.
      /api/deactivate-account - Calls the deactivateUser function. Uses the ValidateJWT handler. Accepts http DELETE requests.
      /api/update-account - Calls the updateUser function. Uses the Validate JWT handler. Accepts http PUT requests.
  main_test - Contains all of the unit tests written for the backend.
Database - SPCB.db:
    Tables:
        Users - A table containing user account details. Implements gorm.model. Primary key is set to email address. Additional fields include: firstname, lastname, and password.
