**Work completed for the frontend**
- Created a settings page where users can choose to edit their first and last name or their password. On either page the user would type in their updated name or password, and hit "SAVE CHANGES". If they want to go back to the previous menu, they can just click on the "GO BACK" button. 
- If the user wants to log out, they can click on the settings page, then click "LOG OUT" on the bottom right corner of the of the page.
