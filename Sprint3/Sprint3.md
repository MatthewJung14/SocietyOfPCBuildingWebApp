**Work completed for the frontend**
- Created a settings page where users can choose to edit their first and last name, their password, or their email. On either page the user would type in their updated name, password, or email, and hit "SAVE CHANGES". If they want to go back to the previous menu, they can just click on the "GO BACK" button. 
- If the user wants to log out, they can click on the settings page, then click "LOG OUT" on the bottom right corner of the of the page.
- Changed the favicon to have our club's logo on it.
- The Navbar now changes based on whether the user is logged in or not. 
- The login button navigates to the home page if the user successfully logs in.
- The signup button navigates to the login page if the user successfully signs up.
- Created a new page called "UPCOMING EVENTS". The Society of PC Building's upcoming events will be posted here. 
- Added more images of various officers on the officer's page.
